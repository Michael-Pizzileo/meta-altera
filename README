The official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Bitmain miners file system.

This layer depends on:

URI: git@github.com:bitmaintech/soc-filesystem.git


When not depending on meta-openembedded and not using systemd, you may need to
mask few miscellaneous recipes requiring systemd, by adding this to local.conf:

BBMASK = "meta-ti/recipes-misc"


The Bitmain miners file system should work with different OpenEmbedded/Yocto
distributions and layer stacks, such as:
distro-less (only with OE-Core), with Yocto/Poky, with Angstrom or Arago.

Please follow the recommended setup procedures of your OE distribution.
